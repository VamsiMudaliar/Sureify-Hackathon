Employee Management Portal using Node,Express and ejs

Let me walk you through the installation part. 

Firstly clone this repo and make sure you have your NPM working correctly,

then install the dependencies via

"npm install"

create a .env file where you can store your sensitive information like DB passwords and stuff. 

later in index.js change the connection string and put your own username and password.

and that's it, your good to go...
